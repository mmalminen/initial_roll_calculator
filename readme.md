# Initiative Roller

	A simple GUI application for tracking initiative in tabletop role-playing games, built with Python and Tkinter.

## Features

	- Add and remove characters dynamically
	- Set modifiers and advantage/disadvantage for each character
	- Roll initiative for all characters simultaneously
	- Resolve ties automatically
	- Display the final initiative order


### How to use:

	2. Set the modifier for each character using the dropdown menu.
